Comparative behavioral ecotoxicology of Inland Silverside larvae exposed to pyrethroids across a salinity gradient

The goal of the relevant study was to assess toxicity to inland silverside larvae following exposure to pyrethroids and different salinities. The data presented here included growth and behavior data from inland silverside larvae exposed to bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, esfenvalerae, and permethrin at 0.5, 2, and 6 PSU.
